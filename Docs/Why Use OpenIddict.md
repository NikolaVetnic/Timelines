OpenIddict brings a lot of “for-free” value to your ASP NET Core authentication/authorization stack:

1. **Standards-compliant OAuth2/OpenID Connect**
   - You get a fully-fledged token endpoint (/connect/token), authorization endpoint, user-info endpoint, introspection, revocation, etc., all out of the box.
   - Because it speaks the official protocols, any OAuth2/OpenID-aware client or library can talk to it without custom glue.
2. **Seamless ASP NET Core & Identity integration**
   - Hooks neatly into ASP NET Core’s DI, authentication/authorization middleware, MVC filters, minimal APIs, even endpoint routing.
   - Plays nicely with ASP NET Core Identity (EF Core stores, user manager, role manager), so you don’t have to write your own user store or password checks.
3. **Token issuance & management**
   - Automatic JWT (or reference token) creation, signing, encryption, expiration.
   - Refresh-token support is built in.
   - You can revoke tokens or implement one-time/use-once schemes without reinventing the wheel.
4. **Validation library for resource servers**
   - Ships a separate “validation” package so your APIs can easily introspect and validate tokens (locally or via introspection) without coupling to the server.
   - You get middleware that populates HttpContext.User with the exact same claims you issued.
5. **Fine-grained claim & scope control**
   - Declaratively register which scopes you support, which claims you emit, and exactly where each claim lands (access token, identity token, etc.).
   - No need to hand–craft JWT payloads or worry about accidentally exposing sensitive data.
6. **Extensibility & customization**
   - Supports custom grant types, token formats, storage back-ends (EF Core, MongoDB or your own store).
   - You can plug in handlers to override parts of the pipeline (e.g., custom introspection logic, new cryptographic algorithms).
7. **Security best practices by default**
   - Built-in support for Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE), DPoP, rotating refresh tokens, reference tokens, revocation endpoints.
   - Regular updates from the community to patch protocol-level vulnerabilities so you’re not rolling your own spec.
8. **Developer productivity**
   - Minimal boilerplate: a few lines in AddOpenIddict(…) plus a small controller (or minimal API) to wire up grants.
   - Rich diagnostics and logging out of the box.
   - Well-documented, with sample templates and community extensions.

**In short**, instead of writing and maintaining your own token issuance, validation, scope management, refresh/revocation flows, and protocol compliance, OpenIddict gives you a battle-tested, pluggable framework that “just works” with ASP NET Core—letting you focus on your business logic, not the intricacies of OAuth2/OpenID Connect.
